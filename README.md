# Ui_Ai_Project
Artificial Intelligence Course Project

In this project, we want to examine some examples of conscious and unconscious search methods in mode space.
For this purpose, you will design an agent inside a two-dimensional maze game of a specific origin.
Moves to a specific destination.
Think of a maze as a 20-by-20 two-dimensional array. Each cell of this array has a position (ùë¶, ùë•)
Starting from the bottom left with the number "0,0" and ending at the top right with "19,19".
This array is either empty or full, which can be displayed in white and black, respectively. Also start two houses.
And there are endings in the array that are randomly selected.
The agent can move up, down, left and right, but cannot move diagonally. Also can not
Enter full cells or move out of the maze. The task of this agent is to find the path from the starting point.
To the endpoint. The shortest route is preferable. Route cost The number of operating movements in that route.
Is. The next page figure shows an example of a maze with starting point and endpoint.
